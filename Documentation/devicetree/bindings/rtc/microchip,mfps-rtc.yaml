  interrupts:
    description: |
      The RTC on the PolarFire SoC has a pair of interrupts. The first is the
      RTC_WAKEUP interrupt. The second, RTC_MATCH, is asserted when the
      content of the Alarm register is equal to that of the RTC's count.
    maxItems: 2

  microchip,prescaler:
    description: |
      The prescaler divides the input frequency to create a time-based strobe (typically 1 Hz) for
      the calendar counter. The Alarm and Compare Registers, in conjunction with the calendar
      counter, facilitate time-matched events. To properly operate in Calendar or Binary mode,
      the 26-bit prescaler must be programmed to generate a strobe to the RTC.
